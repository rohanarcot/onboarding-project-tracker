## 2️⃣ Add Rohan as a collaborator

## 3️⃣ Create your personal markdown file in the `devs` folder

*NOTE* If you have little experience creating a new branch and a pull request, read and watch this before reading further: https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/beginners-guide-to-github-creating-a-pull-request/ 

### Your task:

1. **Create a new branch**
   Example:

   ```
   dev/<yourname>-profile
   ```

2. Inside the `devs/` folder, create a new file named:

```
devs/<yourname>.md
```

Examples:

* `devs/rohan.md`
* `devs/subhash.md`
* `devs/pranav.md`

3. Copy the content from `devs/template.md`

4. Paste it into your file

5. Fill it out with:

   * Your repo link
   * Your status
   * Notes, blockers, or anything you want to share

### Example structure:

```
# Rohan – Onboarding Project

## Repo
https://github.com/rohanarcot/rohan-aboutme

## Status
In Progress

## Notes
- Setup completed
- Working on UI layout
```

---

## 4️⃣ Create a Pull Request with your `.md` file

1. Push your branch
2. Open a Pull Request
3. Request a review from rohanarcot (Rohan) on the top right (Reviewers)
3. PR should contain **only one file**:

   ```
   devs/<yourname>.md
   ```

Rohan will review it, merge it and update the main README table with your repo information.

---

## 5️⃣ Request Code Review (Optional)

If you want feedback on your **actual project repo**:

1. Create a PR (Pull Request) on your actual project aboutme repo and add Rohan as a reviewer

2. Update your `<yourname>.md` file on this tracker repo and create a PR:

   * Set **Status → 🔁 Needs Review**
   * Add your actual project PR link

Rohan will review your code and leave feedback.
